# Europa Open

This project contains the source to the "old" native Android version of the app, as well as the current 1.0.0 version that is Flutter-based. From now on, only the Flutter version will receive future development, but I'm keeping the native Android codebase for educational and historic purposes.

EuropaOpen is a cross-platform mobile application which helps travelers in the European Region navigate various restrictions and obtain important information before embarking on a journey. Data is pulled from [Reopen Europa API](https://reopen.europa.eu/en).

### Usage

Clone the repository. Make sure you have Android Studio (or at least the Android SDK). For the Flutter application, make sure to have the latest stable version of Flutter toolkit installed on your system.

Flutter application is located under `europaopen` directory.
