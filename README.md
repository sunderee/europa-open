# Europa Open

Native Android app which helps travelers in the European Region navigate various travel
restrictions. Data is pulled from [Reopen Europa API](https://reopen.europa.eu/en). You can view my
reversed-engineered API [in Postman](https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/10485728/TzeTKVR4).

Motivation for the app development comes from the lack of similar solutions.

### Usage
